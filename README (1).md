# Trash üéØ

## Basic Details  
### Team Name: Trash  

### Team Members  
- Team Lead: Alvi A V ‚Äì [College]  
- Member 2: Alin Alex ‚Äì [College]  

### Project Description  
A completely quirky web application with hidden features, weird interactions, and lots of surprises! This app is designed to be fun, annoying, and entertaining ‚Äî the kind of app your friends will *love to hate*.  

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
People register on websites too easily these days. There‚Äôs no *real challenge*. Also, online conversations are too straightforward ‚Äî where‚Äôs the chaos?  

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
Make a registration page that‚Äôs *painfully* hard to fill out:  
- Input fields randomly jump around the screen while you‚Äôre typing.  
- The ‚ÄúRegister‚Äù button is a tiny 10x10 pixel nightmare to click.  
And once you finally get in, enjoy a chatroom where everything you say gets flipped into its opposite meaning and sprinkled with random emojis ‚Äî courtesy of the Gemini Flash 1.5 API.
